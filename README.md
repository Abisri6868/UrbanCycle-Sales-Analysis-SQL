UrbanCycle Sales Performance Analysis:(Revenue Loss Investigation (SQL))
📌 Project Overview:
This project investigates a 56% revenue decline at a fictional bike retailer, UrbanCycle. Using SQL, I acted as a Data Analyst to pinpoint exactly why sales dropped and provided data-backed recommendations to the leadership team.
🚩 Business Problem:
In September 2023, UrbanCycle experienced a significant revenue drop. This project uses SQL to investigate whether the decline was due to market trends, regional issues, or operational failures.
🛠️ Skills & Tools:
>>Language: SQL (PostgreSQL)
>>Techniques: Multi-table Joins, CASE Statements, Aggregate Functions, Data Cleaning.
📊 Investigation Steps:
1.Trend Validation: Calculated monthly revenue to confirm the 56% dip.
2.Product Deep-Dive: Identified that "Mountain Bike" sales fell to zero in September.
3.Geographic Analysis: Isolated the sales drop specifically to the East Coast region.
4.Root Cause: Joined sales data with inventory logs to discover a stockout (0 units) in the East warehouse.
